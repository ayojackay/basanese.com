This tracks the parts of my website that I want cool ppl to see. 

As to the parts I want kept between me and the NSA, I'll put those in a submodule for a private repo. 

As to the parts I want kept to myself, I probably shouldn't be putting those on the internet, should I? 

Anyway, here are the important parts of this site: 

 * curriculum vitaes 
 * music 
 * musings 
 * subdomains (nathan.basanese.com anyone?)

## Getting Started ## 
Clone this repo, and put its contents into the public_html part of a shared hosting place. 

The shared virtual host should have a public_html folder.
